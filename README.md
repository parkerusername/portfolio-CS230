# portfolio-CS230

The example project for this course, draw it or lose it, was a cross platform, multiplayer video game. The intention of the course was to plan out this app. 
The game needed to be playable and cost effective across multiple platforms. It needed both a backend for data management as well as a front end for users. 

I feel my recomendations for technology were especially astute. I generally stuck to simple and "boring" technology and recomended industry standards. It's always best
to limit the amount of different pieces of tech in a system, to minimize possible failure states. 

Using a design document makes programming drastically easier. In my opinion, the actual design for the app, as well as the achitecture, is far more difficult and time 
consuming than merely programming the system. I spend far more of my time trying to create systems that are scaleable than I do actually programming.

I wish I could spend more time going in depth into what I believe is good practice when designing a front end. My specialty is javascript, I wish I could have gone
more into some of the finer details.

Considering the users are the ones actually playing the game and generating revenue for the client to pay me with, I'd say that considering them as much as possible
is completely necesary. 

I use a lot of different design patterns when I program, for this project we were required to implement the singleton pattern, one which I use quite often. You just
write the class with the intention that it will not be instantiated again and restrict the ability to instantiate it.
